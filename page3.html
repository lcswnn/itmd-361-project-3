        <h2>Favorite Movie: The Social Network</h2>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB95KLmpLR4?si=7UtAI5NR73UHiQs-" title="The Social Network Movie Trailer" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
        <p>My favorite movie currently would have to be The Social Network, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. The movie is about Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook. In the movie, he is able to simultaneously become the most popular and most hated man on the planet. This movie got me into coding when I first saw it, and ever since then it has stuck with me through the years.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Book: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h2>
        <img src="media/hitchhiker's-guide.jpg" alt="Book Cover of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" class="hitchhiker">
        <p>My Favorite book I've read in the past years has to be The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It follows Arthur Dent and his friend Ford Perfect as they escape Earth and get into trouble along the way. This book made me laugh out loud many times, and even has hidden philosophical messages throughout.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Sport: Baseball</h2>
        <img src="media/baseball.jpg" alt="baseball sitting on pitcher's mound" class="baseball">
        <p>Baseball has been my favorite sport for as long as I can remember. I've always played baseball as my main sport, and even play it here at IIT. Even I can admit that there are many boring lulls in the games, but it is worth it for the many exciting parts of the game.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Artist: John Mayer</h2>
        <img src="media/john-mayer.jpg" alt="John Mayer on the stage playing guitar in spotlights" class="john">
        <p>As a guitar player myself, I would say that my favorite musician would have to be John Mayer. The way he play's guitar is second to none and his songs are really well put together a super catchy at times. You can hear the soul in his music when you listen.</p>
        <p>Lucas's Score: 9.5/10</p>

        <h2>Favorite Place Visited: Hawaii</h2>
        <img src="media/hawaii.jpg" alt="Mountains of Hawaii with ocean front" class="hawaii">
        <p>My favorite place I've been to has to be Hawaii. When we were there, we snorkeled, hiked, and even rode one of the longest zip lines in the world! It was a really beautiful place and I wouldn't hesitate to go again.</p>
